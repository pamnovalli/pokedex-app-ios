## Architeture

Pokedex app was developed using viper architecture, following the principles of _**clean architecture**_ :heart:.

**Viper**:

**V**iew -> Represents everything where the user will interact. <p> 
**I**nteractor -> Represents a use case. <p>
**P**resenter -> Responsible for the logic of vision. <p>
**E**ntity -> Represents the API and / or Bank entity. <p>
**R**outer -> Application navigation logic.<p>

## Project Features

**No Storyboards** :smiley:
